    # will not be enabled in Python virtual enviromments. We therefore
    # wrap the functions for the loading of both the 'sitecustomize' and
    # 'usercustomize' modules but detect when 'usercustomize' support is
    # disabled and in that case do what we need to after 'sitecustomize'
    # is loaded.
    #
    # In wrapping these functions though, we can't actually use wrapt
    # to do so. This is because depending on how wrapt was installed it
    # may technically be dependent on '.pth' evaluation for Python to
    # know where to import it from. The addition of the directory which
    # contains wrapt may not yet have been done. We thus use a simple
    # function wrapper instead.
