requests-negotiate-sspi
=======================

An implementation of HTTP Negotiate authentication for Requests. This
module provides single-sign-on using Kerberos or NTLM using the Windows
SSPI interface.

This module supports Extended Protection for Authentication (aka Channel
Binding Hash), which makes it usable for services that require it,
including Active Directory Federation Services.
